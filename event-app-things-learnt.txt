Things I learnt while building Events App

- React doesn't allow objects like Dates or Arrays as children, 
you need to convert value to string first

- could not find .jpg images until i did declare  module '*.jpg' in index.d.ts
- issue with setting floating label active state

change calendar picker icon color
::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator {
    filter: invert(1);
}
